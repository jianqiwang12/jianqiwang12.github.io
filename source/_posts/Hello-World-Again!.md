In Nov. 2019, I found an UP called CodeSheep. Following his video about building Hexo Blog, I built a small word of mine. <!-- more --> Once, I wanted to write down my favorite content, sharing my life, and what new skills I learned. But it backfired.

Not long ago, I saw the blogs that netizens had build. I wanted to pick it up again. After experiencing the problem that Github can't connect, I decided to switch from Github to Gitee. The link https://jianqiwang12.gitee.io is my new hexo blog that has been deployed on Gitee. 

I hope I can stick to it this time, sharing what I learned, read, and thought. At the same time, gradually making my humble blog rich and beautiful.

Also, I build a hexo blog https://jianqiwang12.github.io on Github. In this blog, I will write in English, improving my English expression ability. There may be a lot of mistakes in the initial stage, but I still hope to get something.
